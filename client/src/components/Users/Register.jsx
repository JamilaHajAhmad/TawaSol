    This is a basic implementation of a registration form using React and Redux.
    The form includes fields for name, email, password, and confirm password.
    The `onChange` function updates the form data as the user types.
    The `onSubmit` function is currently empty, but it should handle form submission,
    including validation and dispatching the `register` action.
    The `mapStateToProps` function maps the `isAuthenticated` state to props,
    which can be used to redirect the user after successful registration.
    The `connect` function from `react-redux` is used to connect the component to the Redux store.
    The `register` and `showAlertMessage` actions are also passed as props.

    => <input></input>: if you add the input tag like this, React will throw an exception.
    The exception will be like this:
    input is a void element tag and must neither have `children` nor use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
